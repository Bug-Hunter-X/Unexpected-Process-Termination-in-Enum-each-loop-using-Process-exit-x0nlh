This repository demonstrates an uncommon Elixir bug related to unexpected process termination within an `Enum.each` loop when using `Process.exit`. The bug occurs because `Process.exit` immediately terminates the current process, preventing the loop from completing. The solution showcases a safer approach using a conditional return within a function and exception handling to ensure clean process termination.
